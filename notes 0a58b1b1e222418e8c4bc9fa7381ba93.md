# **Html tag lists**

- <!doctype> for defining the document type
- <head> contain information about the document
- <b>  bold text
- <br> used for  single line break
- <li> used to define listing item
- <ul>  define unordered list
- <ol> defines ordered list
- <img> define image
- <video> define video
- <h1> to <h6> are html headings
- <input> controls input

# **Css tag lists**

- padding:- short hand property for all the *padding*
- text align:- Specifies the horizontal alignment of text
- font -size:- Specifies the font size of text
- font-style:-  Specifies the font style for text
- border -image:- shorthand property for all the *border-image*
- list-style:-  Sets all the properties for a list in one declaration

# **Html 5**

HTML5 is the newest version of html .Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers.

It includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves, and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup and application programming interface for complex web application.

Many new syntactic features are included.   To natively include and handle multimedia and graphical content, the new <video>, <audio> and <canvas> elements were added, expandable sections are natively implemented through <summary>….</summary> and <details>….</details> rather than depending on CSS or JavaScript, and it  supports for scalable vector graphics (SVG) content and mathML for mathematical formulas was also added. To enrich the semantic content of documents, new page structure elements such as <main>, <section>, <article>, <header>, <footer>, <aside>, <nav>, and <figure> are added. 

when we compare html 5 to html: HTML uses browser cache memory as temporary storage. HTML5 offers multiple storage options, such as an SQL database, application cache, and web storage.

# **CCS3**

is the iteration(new version) of the CSS standard used in the styling and formatting of Web pages. CSS3 incorporates the CSS2 standard with some changes and improvements.

A key change is the division of standard into separate modules, which makes it easier to learn and understand.

CSS3 makes changes to how some visual elements are implemented and rendered by a browser.

CSS3 is separated into separate modules to facilitate development. This means that the specification comes out in chunks, with more stable modules than others.

Some of the major modules of CSS3 are:

- Box model
- Image values and replaced content
- Text effects
- Selectors
- Backgrounds and borders
- Animations.

when we compare CSS3 to css :CSS3 features the Selector concept, whereas CSS does not. Thus, rather than applying classes or IDs for creating styles, developers can use CSS3 to choose HTML elements in place of IDs and classes as attributes to be applied to CSS styles.

# **SCSS(Sassy Cascading Style Sheets)**

is one of the two syntaxes available for the popular CSS preprocessor Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets).the other one is the indented syntax ( .sass ) which is used for indentation purpose.

SCSS  ****is used  to improve our CSS workflow. It can help us keep our code clean and organized, and make it easier to maintain our stylesheets over time.  and it Increase productivity ,More powerful than CSS alone.

the main advantage of SCSS is it adds features to CSS code that are not available in the CSS standard. for example SCSS offers nested so that we can use the nested syntax and useful functions, including color manipulation, math functions, and many other functions.

# **CSS Transitions**

CSS transitions allow us to change property values smoothly, over a given duration. it  provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties.

To create a transition effect, we  must specify two things:

- the CSS property we want to add an effect to
- the duration of the effect, If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0.

The transition effect will start when the specified CSS property (width) changes value.

CSS transitions let us decide which properties to animate (by listing them explicitly), when the animation will start (by setting a delay), how long the transition will last (by setting a duration), and how the transition will run (by defining a timing function).

# **CSS selectors**

CSS selectors are used to tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values . The  elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as the *subject of the selector*.

there are 5 types of selectors :

- Simple selectors : select elements based on name, id, class.
- Combinator selectors : select elements based on a specific relationship between them
- Pseudo-class selectors: select elements based on a certain state
- Pseudo-elements selectors: select and style a part of an element
- Attribute selector :  select elements based on an attribute or attribute value.

# **CSS combinators**

A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.

A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.

There are four different combinators in CSS:

- descendant selector (space): matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.
- child selector (>): selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.
- adjacent sibling selector (+): the adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element. Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".
- general sibling selector (~): selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.

**Example:-**

| Selector | Example | Example description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| element element | div p | Selects all <p> elements inside <div> elements |
| element>element | div > p | Selects all <p> elements where the parent is a <div> element |
| element+element | div + p | Selects the first <p> element that are placed immediately after <div> elements |
| element1~element2 | p ~ ul | Selects every <ul> element that are preceded by a <p> element |

# **XML (The Extensible Markup Language)**

XML is a simple text-based format for representing structured information: documents, data, configuration, books, transactions, invoices, between programs, between people, between computers and people, both locally and across networks. It was derived from an older standard format called SGML (ISO 8879), in order to be more suitable for Web use. it used to define and store data in a shareable manner.

An XML document can contains wide variety of data. For example, **database of numbers, a mathematical equation**.

# **Bootstrap**

**Bootstrap used to get the compiled CSS and JavaScript, source code, or to include it with our favorite package managers like npm, RubyGems, and more.it is most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites, with jsDelivr and a template starter page.** Bootstrap supports the **latest, stable releases** of all major browsers and platforms.

Bootstrap requires the use of the HTML5 doctype. Without it, we’ll see some funky incomplete styling, but including it shouldn’t cause any considerable hiccups(temporary or minor problem).

Bootstrap is developed *mobile first*, a strategy in which we optimize code for mobile devices first and then scale up components as necessary using CSS media queries. To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices, we add the responsive viewport meta tag to our <head>.

Breakpoints are customizable widths that determine how your responsive layout behaves across device or viewport sizes in Bootstrap**.** we  use them to control when our layout can be adapted at a particular viewport or device size.

Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as *grid tiers*, for building responsively.

| breakpoint | Class infix | Dimensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| X-Small | None | <576px |
| Small | sm | ≥576px |
| Medium | md | ≥768px |
| Large | lg | ≥992px |
| Extra large | xl | ≥1200px |
| Extra extra large | xxl | ≥1400px |

Each breakpoint was chosen to comfortably hold containers whose widths are multiples of 12. Breakpoints are also representative of a subset of common device sizes and viewport dimensions—they don’t specifically target every use case or device.

# **Containers**

 ****are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align our content within a given device or viewport. Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are **required when using our default grid system.**

Bootstrap comes with three different containers:

- .container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
- .fluid container, which is width:100% at all breakpoints
- .container.{breakpoint, which is width:100% until the specified breakpoint

| Extra small<576px | Small≥576px | Medium≥768px | Large≥992px | X-Large≥1200px | XX-Large≥1400px |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| .container | 100% | 540px | 720px | 960px | 1140px |
| .container-sm | 100% | 540px | 720px | 960px | 1140px |
| .container-md | 100% | 100% | 720px | 960px | 1140px |
| .container-lg | 100% | 100% | 100% | 960px | 1140px |
| .container-xl | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 1140px |
| .container-xxl | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| .container-fluid | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |

# **uses of bootstrap**

- Bootstrap makes responsive web design a reality. It makes it possible for a web page or app to detect the visitor's screen size and orientation and automatically adapt the display accordingly.
- used to load a program into a computer using a much smaller initial program to load in the desired program, which is usually an os.
- To improve the stability of machine learning (ML) algorithms, Bootstrap sampling is used.
